# Wetlab Calculator
Wetlab Calculator is an spreadsheet-based set of calculators for master mix component volumes and aliquotting volumes for reactions such as PCRs, Golden Gate assemblies, DNA digests, DNA sequencing, and E. coli/yeast transformation reactions. It also has calculators for normalizing DNA concentration, for reagent prep from solids and stock solutions, and for complex dilution series. Each calculator has fields for inputs, such as number of reactions, component quantities, and percent excess volume.

The spreadsheet format makes the formulas apparent and customization easy. Copy calculators and modify for your own use for other kinds of reactions. Let me know of any bugs or suggestions by submitting an issue. I'll post updated versions as new features added. I'll mostly add features when I come to need them, which is how this calculator came to grow over the course of two years in the Dueber Lab at Berkeley.

The change log is in the last tab of the spreadsheet.
