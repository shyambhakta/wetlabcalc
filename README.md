# Wetlab Calculator
Wetlab Calculator is a spreadsheet-based set of calculators for master mix component volumes and aliquotting volumes for reactions such as PCRs, Golden Gate assemblies, DNA digests, and DNA sequencing. It has calculators for interconverting DNA mass and molar concentrations, for normalizing DNAs to standard concentrations, and for calculating sample-specific DNA and water quantities for sequencing. Other calculators assist in reagent prep from solid chemicals and stock solutions, and exact calculations of serial and non-serial complex dilution series with custom, non-factorial concentrations. Each calculator has distinct fields for inputs, such as number of reactions, component quantities, common options, and percent excess volumes.

The spreadsheet format makes the formulas apparent and customization easy. Copy calculators and modify for your own use for other kinds of reactions.

Let me know of any bugs or suggestions by submitting an issue. I'll post updated versions as new features added. I'll mostly add features when I come to need them, which is how this calculator came to grow over the course of two years in the Dueber Lab at Berkeley. The change log is in the last tab of the spreadsheet.
