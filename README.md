# Wetlab Calculator
Wetlab Calculator is an elegant calculator for master mix and aliquotting volumes for PCRs, Golden Gate assemblies, E. coli/yeast transformations, DNA digests, and sequencing reactions. It also has calculators for normalizing DNA concentration, for reagent prep from solids and stock solutions, and for non-factorial dilution series.

Clone calculators and modify for your own use, e.g. for Gibson assemblies or PCRs with more inputs. Let me know of any bugs, or you can send me an update yourself, and I'll incorporate it. I'll mostly add features when I come to need them, which is how this calculator came to grow over the course of two years in the Dueber Lab at Berkeley.
